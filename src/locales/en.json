So, I released them into the Hollywood hills. \nWatching them disappear into the wild, I realized their spikes weren't a weapon—they were a protective shell, a gentle defense for surviving in a vast world. \nThat's when it hit me: like those hedgehogs, people with sharp style use it as protection to stay true to themselves. \nPaidstyle exists to celebrate and safeguard this personal armor through our products.",
